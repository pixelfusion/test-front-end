# Fog Test
A front-end orientated challenge designed for candidates.

### Task
You are asked to build a client-side app implementing this [design](https://github.com/pixelfusion/test-front-end/tree/master/design). There will be other pages that need to be supported. You need to show that you can set up a front end project from the given design. You need to spend no more than two hours.
Technical requirements:
* React-based single page application
* Responsive design
Your code should be ready to handle the evolution of the layout and technical requirements, e.g. brand color changes or server-side rendering.
The assets are provided [here](https://github.com/pixelfusion/test-front-end/tree/master/assets).

### Submission
1. Create a **private repository** using Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab and give [developer@pixelfusion.co.nz](mailto:developer@pixelfusion.co.nz) access
2. Or alternatively you can send us a ZIP
